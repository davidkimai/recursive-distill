# Recursive Distill: System Architecture

## 1. System Overview

Recursive Distill is a decentralized research publishing ecosystem that transforms GitHub's infrastructure into a living, self-refining journal system. It preserves the core values of Distill.pub (clarity, interactive explanation, scientific integrity) while embracing decentralization, recursive improvement, and epistemic divergence.

### 1.1 Architectural Philosophy

Our architecture is guided by several key principles:

- **Recursion over stasis**: Research is never "final" but always evolving
- **Coherence over centralization**: Integrity through shared metrics, not central authority
- **Emergence over enforcement**: Rules emerge from participation, not dictation
- **Attribution through network analysis**: Credit is traced through contribution graphs
- **Symbolic residue as signal**: Failures reveal important epistemological insights

### 1.2 System Topology

The system architecture mirrors GitHub's infrastructure but inverts its purpose:

## 2. Inversion of GitHub Elements

### 2.1 Repositories as Recursive Containers

**GitHub Function**: Code storage and version control
**Recursive Distill Function**: Living research containers that evolve over time

Each article in Recursive Distill exists as a GitHub repository, containing:

- Markdown/HTML source for the article text
- JavaScript for interactive elements
- Data files and analysis code

- Representatives from each research domain
- Rotating membership based on contribution metrics
- Transparent decision processes via public discussions
- Constitution maintained in the meta repository

### 6.2 Recursive Amendment Process

The governance system itself is subject to recursive improvement:

1. Issue raised in meta repository
2. Discussion period
3. PR with proposed changes
4. Vote by current council
5. Implementation of approved changes

### 6.3 Domain-Specific Standards

Each research domain can establish specific standards:

- Methodological requirements
- Data sharing practices
- Visualization approaches
- Specialized review criteria

These standards are documented in domain repositories and wikis.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

- **Engagement**: Forks, discussions, improvement cycles
- **Coherence**: Average coherence scores across articles
- **Attribution**: Density and fairness of attribution graphs
- **Evolution**: Rate and quality of improvements to articles
- **Residue Value**: Insights gained from tracked residue

## 9. Conclusion

Recursive Distill represents a fundamental reimagining of academic publishing, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure to create a decentralized, self-improving ecosystem for research. By inverting traditional models of publication, review, and attribution, we create space for ongoing evolution of knowledge, transparent critique, and diverse epistemological perspectives.

The system is designed to be fractal—each component embodies the principles of the whole. Every article is a microcosm of the journal, every review a recursive loop of improvement, every fork a new branch in the evolutionary tree of knowledge.

Through this architecture, we aim to honor the legacy of Distill.pub while creating a more resilient, collaborative, and generative system for the future of research publishing.
