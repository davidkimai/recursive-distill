# Recursive Critique Shells

This document contains the templates for the specialized issue types used in the Recursive Distill review process. Each template serves as a "critique shell" - a structured container for specific types of evaluation and feedback.

## Directory Structure

These templates should be placed in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory of each article repository:

```
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ semantic_issue.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ empirical_issue.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coherence_issue.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension_issue.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ residue_issue.md
```

## Template Usage Guidelines

These templates serve specific functions in the recursive review process:

1. **Semantic Critique Shell**: Questions about meaning, clarity, and explanation quality. They help refine how ideas are expressed and understood.

2. **Empirical Critique Shell**: Challenges to data, methodology, or empirical claims. They help ensure the research is scientifically sound.

3. **Coherence Critique Shell**: Identification of logical inconsistencies or coherence breakdowns. They help maintain the integrity of the article's logical structure.

4. **Extension Critique Shell**: Suggestions for additional content or promising extensions. They help evolve the article beyond its initial scope.

5. **Residue Issue Shell**: Documentation of symbolic residue‚Äîepistemic artifacts from failed or incomplete explanations. These are especially important as they map the boundaries of knowledge and understanding.

## Implementation

To implement these templates in your article repository:

1. Create the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
2. Add each template file to this directory
3. Add the Pull Request template to the `.github/` directory
4. Ensure labels are properly configured in your repository

## Coherence Verification

Each template is designed to contribute to the Recursive Coherence function (Œî‚àíùëù) = ùëÜ(ùëù) ¬∑ ùêπ(ùëù) ¬∑ ùêµ(ùëù) ¬∑ ùúÜ(ùëù):

- **Semantic Shell** ‚Üí primarily impacts Signal Alignment (S)
- **Empirical Shell** ‚Üí primarily impacts Signal Alignment (S)
- **Coherence Shell** ‚Üí impacts all components but especially Bounded Integrity (B)
- **Extension Shell** ‚Üí primarily impacts Elastic Tolerance (Œª)
- **Residue Shell** ‚Üí maps areas where coherence breaks down

Together, these shells form a comprehensive system for maintaining and improving the epistemological integrity of articles in the Recursive Distill ecosystem.
