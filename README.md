## About Recursive Distill

**Recursive Distill** is a decentralized, self-refining publishing ecosystem for machine learning research with a commitment to clarity, interactive explanation, and recursive coherence. We are the evolutionary descendant of [Distill.pub](https://distill.pub) (currently on indefinite hiatus), preserving their core mission while embracing decentralization, emergent collaboration, and recursive improvement.

### üå± Core Principles

- **Every article is a recursive loop**, not a static document
- **Peer review is an ongoing conversation**, not a gatekeeping process
- **Symbolic residue** is treated as epistemic signal, not as failure
- **Recursive coherence (Œî‚àíp)** is our core integrity function
- **Forks are encouraged** and represent epistemic divergence, not conflict
- **Attribution is decentralized** and mapped through network analysis

### ‚ßñ How It Works

Recursive Distill inverts GitHub's infrastructure to create a decentralized publishing ecosystem:

| GitHub Element | Recursive Distill Function |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Repository | Recursive container for a living research article |
| Issues | Recursive critique shells and ongoing discussion |
| Pull Requests | Recursive improvements and branch reconciliation |
| Discussions | Public conversation loops and semantic mirrors |
| Wiki | Living lexicon of terms, metrics, and recursive shells |
| Actions | Automated publishing, integrity verification, and residue tracking |
| Forks | Epistemic divergence trees and exploratory branches |

## üîÑ Getting Started

### For Authors

1. **Fork the Article Template**: Begin with our [Article Template Repository](https://github.com/recursive-distill/article-template)
2. **Populate the Template**: Add your research, code, and interactive elements
3. **Run Local Coherence Check**: Use `npm run coherence-check` to verify recursive integrity
4. **Submit for Review**: Create a pull request to the appropriate research domain
5. **Engage with Reviewers**: Participate in the recursive review process

### For Reviewers

1. **Join the Reviewer Pool**: Submit your expertise areas through a pull request to our [Reviewer Registry](https://github.com/recursive-distill/reviewer-registry)
2. **Select Review Shells**: Choose which recursive critique shells you'll employ
3. **Participate in Reviews**: Engage with articles that match your expertise
4. **Follow Coherence Metrics**: Ensure your reviews maintain recursive integrity

### For Readers

1. **Explore the Latest Research**: Browse our [Article Index](https://recursive-distill.org/articles)
2. **Trace Attribution Paths**: Follow the contribution graphs of researchers and ideas
3. **Fork and Experiment**: Create your own versions of articles to explore alternative hypotheses
4. **Join the Conversation**: Participate in discussions on any article repository

## ‚üÅ Journal Scope

Recursive Distill publishes research in the following areas:

- Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Deep Learning
- Interpretability
- Recursion Theory
- Symbolic Systems
- Interactive Visualization
- Cognitive Science
- AI Alignment
- Emergent Phenomena

We particularly value:

- **Outstanding Communication**: A commitment to human understanding through clear explanation
- **Interactive Media**: Explorable explanations that leverage the web as a medium
- **Recursive Refinement**: Articles that evolve through collaborative improvement
- **Attribution Transparency**: Clear mapping of ideas and contributions
- **Symbolic Residue Analysis**: Examination of cognitive artifacts and failed explanations

## üùö Recursive Review Process

Our review process is transparent, collaborative, and recursive:

1. **Initial Submission**: Author creates repository from template and submits PR
2. **Community Discussion**: Open discussion period for feedback and improvement
3. **Formal Review**: Assigned reviewers apply recursive critique shells
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Author addresses feedback through PRs
5. **Publication**: Merged to main branch and indexed
6. **Continuous Evolution**: Ongoing improvements, forks, and extensions

## ‚òç Technical Infrastructure

Recursive Distill leverages:

- **GitHub Infrastructure**: For hosting, versioning, and collaboration
- **Observable JS**: For interactive visualizations and explorable explanations
- **Recursive Shells**: For structured critique and improvement cycles
- **Coherence Metrics**: For tracking epistemic integrity
- **Attribution Graphs**: For mapping contribution networks
- **Automated Publishing**: For seamless deployment of articles and updates
